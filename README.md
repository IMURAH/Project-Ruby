* This project assignment contains a bunch of short answers.
* This project assignment contains a programming problem need to be solved by ruby.
* This project assignment contains a documentation which consists of writing this readme file.
* This project assignment contains a thinking assignment.

## Quick Start

#### Short Answer

Some short answer questions regarding ideas and ability to use ruby proficiently. Which will be turned in one pdf file.
